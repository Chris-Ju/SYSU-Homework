# Description

In elementary algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation having the form 

Your task is to calculate the two roots of the quadratic equation

# Input

The first line of the input is an integer T indicating the number of cases. 

Line 2..T+1 will contain three numbers a, b, c each. It fits coefficients order above.

Use double!

 
# Output

If the quadratic equation has no roots, outputs "no answers"

Otherwise, output the two roots, rounded to two decimal places

P.S. always output two roots, even if they are equal
