# Alipay System 2 User Controller(eden)

## Introduction
You must have enjoyed the programming question last week. This week, we will have a more detailed Alipay system and you may spend even more time to finish it, try it hard. Moreover, you will have some practice about heap memory allocation and memory garbage collection.

 

## Requirements
You are going to finish the function definitions of the two classes userController and user. User which we have designed it last week will have some differences. And there are some inline functions that have been finished by me. They will help you a lot to understand the whole class and also they are useful for many member functions.

You can now start to finish the functions according to the comments and the function prototypes.



 

## Notice:

* Function prototype is very important. You should know it when you are learning c language. You should pay more attention to it and have a deep study.
* Well, the most annoying but effective tool in c++ is pointer. You should be attention to the operation of the pointers in the class. It will be very annoying when eden tells you there will be a lot of memory problems. And this is why I let you to use char * instead of the class string. (Well, we will use it later)
* There is an overloaded assignment operator in the class user. If you don't know operator overloading, just leave it alone or you can study it by yourself. Without doubt, the latter is better, much better.
* As we use cstrings(char []), I recommend you to make use of the cstring library.

It will be difficult for you to finish this assignment. Try your best to do it. And the script I made may have bugs, if you have any question about this assignment, please send me an email. Next time we will have a next level design for the payment system. And you are going to design the class yourself. Have a good time.
